								</span><h4>Journey of a single mother with 6 children</h4>
								<p>
								Today, I would like to introduce to you my grandmother <a href="https://m.baobinhduong.vn/mai-la-tam-guong-sang--a56695.html" class="link"><strong><u>Be a shining example for future generations</u></strong></a>, Many people know Mrs. Nguyen Thi Bay, in Tan Phuoc Khanh town (Tan Uyen), because she is not only the President of the Association of the Elderly, but also a successful businesswoman. Although she is old, Mrs. Bay is very agile in business, association activities and charity activities. And the mother of two chairmen of the board of directors of the company where I had the opportunity to intern, <strong>PLC Co.,Ltd</strong> and <a href="https://baobinhduong.vn/giu-nghe-nghe-khong-phu-a44720.html" class="link"><strong><u>Thanh Loc Bamboo Rattan Enterprise</u></strong></a>. 
								I grew up under her guidance, and she often said, "Once the housework is done, we should extend our care beyond the household." Indeed, my grandmother, as a single mother, raised five of her own children and one stepchild. At the age of 55, she became the head of the Elderly Association in our local community. Now, even in her late 70s, she continues to be dedicated to her work, spreading love and compassion to the elderly living alone, families in difficult situations, and veterans. She actively participates in social work, from providing medical care for the elderly to charity work and organizing funerals for those who have passed away.

											<h4>Trade-offs and sacrifices</h4>
												My father <i> is the man wearing the black shirts</i> in the photo. In my eyes, he is truly great. He is a shining example of lifelong learning and has taught me that education is a lifelong journey. My father used to be an excellent student, but due to family circumstances and the responsibility of taking care of his younger siblings, he had to put aside his studies and dreams to support them. He sacrificed everything for his family, always putting others before himself.
												<br/>He taught me that before you can be successful, you must first become a good person, someone who is useful to society. This is why I want to do something beneficial for others. My grandmother and my father are the two people who have inspired me the most. My grandmother has shown me the importance of overcoming adversity, the greatness of love, and the value of family. My father has taught me discipline, perseverance, and never to give up. Even now, he continues to learn through online courses, staying updated and knowledgeable about everything. I often wonder when I will be able to be like him!

										Seeing my grandmother, at the age of 75, still dedicated to serving the community fills me with immense pride and emotion. She is a tremendous source of inspiration, not just for our family but for many others in the community. Her enthusiasm and commitment are clear evidence that age is not a barrier to love and the desire to contribute. From her, I have learned the value of perseverance and compassion, qualities she has embodied throughout her life. She is not only a beloved grandmother but also a devoted leader with a golden heart, always caring for others. I am truly grateful and aspire to continue the beautiful legacy she has created.</p>

									<h2>Spiritual Values and Legacy</h2>

								<p>
									My grandmother life and work have brought tremendous value to our community and our family. Her tireless dedication to helping others, especially the elderly and those in need, demonstrated deep compassion and a commitment to serving society. She taught us the importance of resilience, altruism, and the power of a kind heart. The values ‚Äã‚Äãshe instilled in us and the countless lives she touched are her lasting legacy. My grandmother‚Äôs efforts remind us that true success lies not in material wealth, but in the positive impact we make on the lives of others. Her example inspires us to continue her mission of spreading love, kindness, and support wherever it is needed.</p>
