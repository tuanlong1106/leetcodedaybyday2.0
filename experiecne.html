									<h1>My Experience ðŸ“– </h1>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p> 
									After more than six years of balancing work and study, I immersed myself in a wide range of experiences that shaped both my professional and academic journey. This period taught me valuable lessons in time management, discipline, and resilience. While pursuing my education, I took on various roles, from administrative positions to internships, which not only helped me financially but also provided practical insights into different industries. Although challenging, this experience was incredibly rewarding, laying a strong foundation for my transition into full-time coding. It allowed me to develop a versatile skill set and a deep understanding of real-world applications, ultimately guiding me toward my passion for technology and software development. After years of studying and working in various roles within human resources and administration, I made the pivotal decision to set aside my degree to pursue coding. This marks a significant turning point in my life, opening a new chapter where I am focused on developing technological products and software solutions while continuing to explore and grow in a promising new field.

											<h3>The first time I was on TV</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This was the first time in my life that I participated in such an international event. The image was featured by Binh Duong province's BTV station during the HORASIS CHINA 2024 economic cooperation forum. I was invited to attend as a representative of the business sector. During the forum, I learned about investment promotion policies and the development potential for Chinese investors in Vietnam. The gentleman wearing glasses sitting next to me is the Business Manager of Sources and Tool Shenyang Co., Ltd. He was there representing the company in discussions with Shanghai Jiao Tong University about potential collaborations. I see great potential in technology development in Binh Duong, with favorable support policies for senior personnel, including programmers, making it one of the leading industrial parks in the southern region.
