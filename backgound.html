												<h3>Dream</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
													I graduated from Nguyen Khuyen High School. In 2018, I turning to TDTU, At TDTU was not an excellent student. I decided to gap 2 years from University when the COVID-19 pandemic happened. I stay home do some remote work, self-awareness. I am so grateful that I got through the covid period alone in HCM without my family by my side. So that I could experience many things to have me like today writing these lines. 
													<br/>And in July 2022, I returned to school and started studying seriously and I completed the program in Dec 2023. But to hold the ceremony, I had to wait until May 2024 to graduate
													For some people, this may be a waste of time. For me, I choose not to regret, but instead I am very grateful for 6 years of studying and working, experiencing life enough for me to understand the nature of a human being. And now I want to rebuild from the inside to have enough foundation to become an entrepreneur.

												<h3>üßæ Too young to become an ENTREPRENEUR </h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												<p>Too young to understand that a dream isn't always something that must be achieved at all costs, or even something one can accomplish in a lifetime. One day, you'll realize the true meaning of a dream.
												<br/>  It's not about whether it aligns with your practical abilities. The important thing is that it allows you to live another life with your own unique emotions.
												<br/>To be honest, I don't have any idea to start a business yet. But I believe I can do it in the future.
												I still keep up with my studies, gym, and leetcode build strong community in Threads. Hopefully one day success will come to those who persevere.</p>

												<h3>üê∫ If you choose to be a leader, you must be a pioneer</h3>

											<p>
												<li>2016 - 2018 (Stop actived) - With a young boy full of ambition and dreams with a burning passion for shoes. My group of friends and I pioneered the establishment of a private group where we could share our passion for shoes. I maintained the group and organized an offline event and raised funds for charity when I was 16 years old (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1039361546120820"><u>Facebook</u></a>).</li>
												<li>2020 - End COVID-19 with social distancing. I was alone in a strange city without family or friends and had to fight covid. At that time, I only dared to wish that I could survive it. I did nothing but play games. I must have been addicted to games at that time and I ran a group of 25 people in GTAV. And my group had the fewest members in the server and had climbed to the top 1 at that time. Here I learned a lot of lessons about online teamwork and realized how many pros and cons lead to work efficiency. And I began to realize and like working remotely</li>

												Sharing my daily process of solving algorithms has become an important part of my learning journey. I document the challenges I face, the approaches I take, and the lessons I learn. Surprisingly, these posts have inspired others. My persistence and effort have not only helped me grow but have also motivated others facing similar challenges. It's rewarding to see that by sharing my personal experiences, I can encourage and support others in their learning paths.
